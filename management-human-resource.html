            WHAT IS MANAGEMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES?
        </h2>
        <p class="default-para font-size-20 line-height-16">
            Talent management is a primary concern of today’s employers. Through project-based
            learning and experiential exercises, students majoring in Management and Human Resources
            (MHR) will gain an intensive understanding of the concepts and techniques needed to
            effectively manage, recruit, select, train, develop, and retain organizational human capital.
            The MHR major is best suited for those who have a strong interest in the human element of
            organizations and how it can contribute to organizational success.
