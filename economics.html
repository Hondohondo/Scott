            WHAT IS ECONOMICS?
        </h2>
        <p class="default-para font-size-20 line-height-16">
            Economics is a major for those who want to learn how to think â€” not simply what to think.
            It provides an analytical framework to help you better understand the world around you while
            equipping you to be more actively engaged. Economists study the way that people,
            groups, institutions and governments behave when attempting to reconcile their limited
            resources with their unlimited wants. Because economics is a social science, the only social
            science honored by its own Nobel Prize, real world data tests its theories. Consequently,
            economists often gather and analyze data to understand how economies and markets operate
            and how people make economic choices.

                ECONOMICS AT THE BOLER COLLEGE OF BUSINESS
            </h3>

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                At the Boler College of Business, the strength of the economics major is its
                flexibility. Students have the ability to choose personal areas of interest. Students
                can take an analytical route by class choices like econometrics and higher level
                math courses. Alternatively, students can take a less math intensive route with
                class choices that focus on social and policy perspectives. All paths prepare
                individuals to make optimal decisions based on available information. That
                preparation makes a difference.
            </p>

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                Students can choose to pursue either a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science.
                The economics major is a popular double major with finance, wealth
                management, political science, sports studies and other majors. An economics
                second major, or an economics minor, will diversify your potential and provide
                many rewarding options in wide-ranging careers.
            </p>

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                Students who intend to pursue graduate work in economics, public policy, or
                business are encouraged to take additional math classes.

                The Economics Program is the first undergraduate program partnered
                with NABE for preparation pathways for the CBE exam. The CBE is a
                professional certification that confirms the knowledge and the skills
                required to succeed as a business economist.

                CAREER PROSPECTS
            </h3>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-24">
                Economics majors are successful in a wide variety of academic and
                professional fields. They work as research and financial analysts in large
                corporations and small businesses, consulting firms, and at all levels
                of government. An economics major provides students with a broad
                range of analytical, quantitative, and communication skills that are
                useful in many different occupations in management, finance, banking,
                public administration, non-profit organizations, and community service.
                In addition, an economics degree prepares students for graduate
                work in economics, and is excellent preparation for students planning
                to attend law school (economics majors tend to score higher on the
                LSAT compared to all other majors), pursue a Master of Business
                Administration or further their education in public policy analysis.
