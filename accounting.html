            WHAT IS ACCOUNTING?
        </h2>
        <p class="default-para font-size-20 line-height-16">
            Accounting is recognized as a basic component of business management. It is a means
            by which managers, investors, and creditors are kept informed of the financial status of a
            business enterprise for purposes of control, decision making, and investing. Accounting,
            “the language of business”, is fundamental to successful management as well as the basis
            for maintaining credible stewardship of any sizable organization.

                WHY STUDY ACCOUNTING AT BOLER?
            </h3>
            <p class="para line-height-16">
                Accountancy majors at John Carroll’s Boler College of Business are exposed to
                aspects of international accounting and the application of professional ethics
                throughout the curriculum. While the orientation is to instill technical competence
                and develop analytical skills in accounting, the department is aware that students
                who decide to major in accounting must also have a firm background in the liberal
                arts, sciences, business administration and communications. That is why the rich
                tradition of the Jesuit liberal arts curriculum at John Carroll University contributes
                to developing the mental dexterity and analytical competence essential for any
                functioning member of our increasingly complex society.
            </p>
            <p class="para line-height-16">
                The primary objective of the department is to prepare students for a career in
                professional accounting, but the faculty also are dedicated to developing the
                whole student, one that is able to use the many skills learned at Boler when
                embarking on his or her chosen career. In accordance with the mission of John
                Carroll, excellence in teaching is emphasized as well as faculty and student interaction on academic and personal levels. This bond between student and faculty
                member can be seen on a daily basis as students grapple with difficult subjects
                and are assisted in their exploration by the extremely dedicated department staff.

                    <p><strong>Fifth-year Masters Program:</strong> Ohio and most other states require CPA
                        candidates to have obtained 150 semester hours (i.e., a fifth year) of
                        education in order to be eligible to sit for the CPA exam and to be licensed
                        as a CPA upon successful completion of the exam. Students who earn a
                        bachelor’s degree majoring in Accountancy can satisfy this requirement by
                        taking additional undergraduate courses to earn the total of 150 hours, or
                        entering a Master’s program. Two masters-level programs which will satisfy
                        most states’ requirements are offered at John Carroll and both of them
                        can be completed in just over one calendar year. Students can choose to
                        earn a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) or a Master’s of Science
                        in Accountancy</p>
