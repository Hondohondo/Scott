            What is Supply Chain Management?
        </h2>
        <p class="default-para font-size-20 line-height-16">
            Supply chain management (SCM) is the oversight of materials, information, and finances as they move in a process from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. Supply chain management involves coordinating and integrating these flows both within  and among companies. Effective supply chain management improves business performance and provides value to customers. Supply chain management involves transportation,  warehousing, channel management, purchasing, inventory control, order processing, and  customer satisfaction.

                Why Study Supply Chain Management at Boler?

            <p class="para line-height-16">
                The field is extensive, and many businesses are potential employers. There is a shortage of college graduates to fill available entry-level positions, and these opportunities are expected to grow (over 1.5 million openings in the next several years) because of the increasing emphasis on the efficient movement of goods and information. Our SCM program incorporates the best-in-class methods, concepts and tools that companies need to gain that competitive advantage. We have an experienced faculty that is involved in professional organizations and businesses in supply chain management. Many students have internship opportu-nities in SCM, and these opportunities provide the student with valuable practical experience in supply chain management.
