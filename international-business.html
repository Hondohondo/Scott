            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                Today’s business world environment is inherently global. The typical twenty-first
                century corporation’s operations — even its domestic operations — are deeply
                affected by overseas economic factors. The same is true for governmental or
                non-profit organizations, whose interests today often involve activities in other
                nations. International Business is the specialization that prepares managers,
                whether they are self-employed or working for small, mid-sized or large
                corporations, to meet the challenges of doing business at home and abroad.

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                If you choose to major in International Business with Language and Culture
                (IBLC), you will graduate with invaluable experience. Our program allows you
                to participate in real-world, course-level activities with international businesses
                and organizations.

                  What does the IBLC major look like?
              </h3>

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                IBLC majors must take foreign language courses through the 300 level in order
                be introduced to the basic vocabulary of business and are encouraged to take
                courses that focus on some aspect of the culture of the country associated with
                that language. In these classes you’ll cover contemporary political, social, and/or
                economic factors through a historical and/or cultural perspective, allowing you to
                see how the country became what it is today.
            </p>

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                The business core courses will assure that you have a broad and solid
                understanding of all the business functions. The required international business
                courses will assure that you have all the technical knowledge required in
                international business contexts. The international business electives give you
                the opportunity to specialize your knowledge in marketing, finance, economics
                or supply chain management. In addition, there are two practical requirements
                to the major: a semester abroad and an international or domestic internship.

                IBLC majors must complete an international or domestic internship. You are
                encouraged to pursue the international internship because it will greatly enhance
                your marketability. The international internship could be completed during your
                semester abroad or during the summer following the semester abroad. You can
                complete a domestic internship with a U.S.-based organization. The internship
                must have an international component or international linkage. You will work
                with the director of the IBLC major and the office of the BSOB Internship and
                Employer Relations Coordinator to connect with internship opportunities.
