            WHAT IS FINANCE?
        </h2>
        <p class="default-para font-size-20 line-height-16">
            In simplest terms, finance is the study of money - how individuals and organizations obtain funds
            and what they do – or should do - with the funds. Students encounter wide-ranging problems in
            finance from assessing business performance and valuing securities to determining the best option
            for a personal loan or retirement plan. Learning theoretical and practical approaches to solving these
            problems provides graduating finance majors with knowledge and skills broadly demanded by
            employers, including businesses, financial institutions, governments, and regulatory agencies.

                WHY STUDY FINANCE AT BOLER?
            </h3>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                The Boler College of Business finance program provides students with
                knowledge and skills in all areas of finance. In particular, students gain in-depth
                knowledge of financial markets, instruments and theories. In addition, the finance
                curriculum has a unique sequence of coursework that prepares students for
                careers in a corporate finance. Our graduating seniors in finance have the skills
                necessary to define and solve financial management problems, and the ability
                to articulate financial problems and propose appropriate solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                The major is one of an elite group of undergraduate programs affiliated with
                the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute (CFA Institute). This certification
                assures that our students are grounded in investment analysis and real-world
                portfolio management skills. The CFA Institute also provides scholarships for
                Boler students interested in taking the CFA exam.
            </p>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                The Boler College’s computer lab includes a Bloomberg Terminal, a platform that
                is used by most major financial firms in the United States. Bloomberg Terminals
                enable students to work with the latest and most powerful financial software and
                data. From their first to their last semester, finance majors use the Boler computer
                lab for assignments and projects, building proficiency that will help them attain
                in-demand professional skills.

            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                The Boler Finance Student Association recruits and hosts guest speakers, and
                provides opportunities for members to attend professional networking events.
                The Association also organizes and leads an annual trip to either NYC or Chicago
                to visit major financial sector companies such as the NYSE, the Chicago
                Mercantile Exchange, banks, investment banks, and hedge funds.
            </p>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-16">
                Students in the finance program also have the opportunity to apply their
                knowledge in real world scenarios through participation in management of
                the Dornam Fund, Boler’s student managed investment fund. Boler has just
                recently added a second student managed fund that focuses on equity
                securities that have recently become publicly traded.

                FINANCE AS A VALUE-ADDED SECOND MAJOR
            </h3>
            <p class="para line-height-16 mg-bm-24">
                The finance major can be successfully combined with other areas of study.
                At Boler, many finance majors add a second major in accounting, economics,
                or financial planning and wealth management. These double majors are a
                powerful combination for individuals aspiring to high level leadership positions
                in the corporate world.
